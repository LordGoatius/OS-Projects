# OS-Projects

There are 2 submodules in this repository. One, JimOS_old contains code from a mixture of following a github tutorial and my own additions, where a bootloader is created and an operating system kernel is developed using C and assembly.

The second, JimOS is a more advanved, but more handheld tutorial, where an operating system is built in Rust using preexisting crates, although signifigant knowledge was still required to get it working.

Each of these were done because I want to do systems development, and the pace my university was working at was too slow. Being a transfer student, class organization and prioritization is harder than usual, so I decided to do it myself.
